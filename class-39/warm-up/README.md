# Warm Up

For today's warm up we are going to be learning about debugging in Python and practicing debugging inside of a repl.

Instructions:

- Read [debugging-guide.md](./debugging-guide.md)
- Debug the `reverse_ll()` function in [this repl](https://replit.com/@AdamOwada/Python-Warm-Up-Class-39#)

Discussion:

- How would you expect a working `reverse_ll()` function to be working?
- How can you tell the function is broken?
- Can you trace the error using the debugger?
- What's the correct code?
