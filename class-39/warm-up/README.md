# Warm Up

For today's warm up we are going to be learning about debugging in Python and practicing debugging inside of a repl.

Instructions:

- Read [debugging-guide.md](./debugging-guide.md)
- Debug the `reverse_ll()` function in [this repl](https://replit.com/@AdamOwada/Python-Warm-Up-Class-39#)

How can you tell its broken?
Can you trace the error using the debugger?
What's the correct code?
